** TODO improve refs in configuration [0/3]

   Only many-to-one relations look sensible at the moment.

   - [ ] one-to-many and one-to-one should be really easy to write down
   - [ ] many-to-many does not allow a non-unique variant
   - [ ] many-to-many uniqueness where one side is to be exhausted first looks
     funky

** TODO ability to provide seed in command line

   Running from the command line will, currently, always yield the same
   result.  It should use a random seed unless a seed is provided.

** TODO obsolete and ns generators

   All these are thinly wrapped by config/generators

** TODO allow dots as type/attribute separator

   Dots are more pleasing to JSON acquainted eyes.

** TODO dep shortcut by allowing omission of type when inferable

   Referring to self should not require a type prefix.
